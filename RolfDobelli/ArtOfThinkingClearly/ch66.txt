hat do you think of genetically modified wheat?
It's a complex issue. You don't want to answer
too hastily. A rational approach would be to con-

.ider the controversial technology's pros and cons separately.
\Vrite down the possible benefits, weight them in terms of
:mportance, and then multiply them by the probability that
:hey will occur. Doing so, you get a list of expected values.
\ext, do the same with the cons. List all the disadvantages,
:stimate their potential damage, and multiply them by the
-rkelihood of them happening. The positive sum minus the
:-egative sum equals the net expected value. If it is above
rero, you are in favor of genetically modified wheat. If the
,';m is below zeto, yot). are against it. More than likely you
"-ave already heard of this approach. It is called "expected
'. alue," and it features in most literature on decision theory.
3ut just as probable is that you've never bothered to carry
