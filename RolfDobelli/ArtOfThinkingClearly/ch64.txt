How to Expose a Charlatan
Forer Effect

ear reader, it may surprise you, but I know you per-
sonally" This is how I would sum you up: "You have
a great need for other people to like and admire you.

: ou have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a, great
:eal of unused capacity, which you have not turned to your ad-
lntage. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are
-enera1ly able to compensate for them. Your sexual adjustment
-.rs presented problems for you. Disciplined and self:controlled
ltside , you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside. At times
ru have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right
::cision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of
aange and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in
'-,'restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as an inde-
:ndent thinker and do not accept others' statements without
::isfactory proof. You have found it unwise to be too frank
. revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted,
-ible, and sociable while at other times you are introverted,
':r1,, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty
:,realistic. Security is one of your major goals in life."
