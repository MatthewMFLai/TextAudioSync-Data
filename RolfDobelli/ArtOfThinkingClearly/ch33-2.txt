The Art sf Tbi&i.ing ClearlY

in terms of accountability. Nobody wants to take the rap for
the misdeeds or poor decisions of the whole grouP' A glar-
ing example is the prosecution of the Nazis at the Nuremberg
trials or, less controversialiy, any board or management team'
we hide behind team decisions. The technical term for this is
"diffusion of responsibility." For the same reason, teams tend to
take bigger risks than their members would take on their own-
The individual group members reason that they are not the
only ones who will be blamed if things go wrong. This effect is
called "risky shift" and is especially hazardous among comPanr
and pension-fund strategists, where billions are at stake, or in
the Defense Department, where groups decide on the use of
nuclear weapons.
In conciusion: People behave differently in groups than
when alone (otherwise there would be no groups)' The disad-
vantages of groups can be mitigated by making individual per-
formances as visible as possible. Long live meritocracy! Long
live the performance societY!
