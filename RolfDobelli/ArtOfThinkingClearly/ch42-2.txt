Framing is used to good effect in commerce, too. Consider
-sed cars. You are 1ed to focus on just a few factors, whether the
::-essage is delivered through a salesman, a sign touting certain
:iatures, or even your own criteria. For example, if the car has
:::e low mileage and good tires, you home in on this and over-
-...ok the state of the engine, the brakes, or the interior. Thus,
:::e mileage and tires become the main selling points and frame
-:r decision to buy. Such oversight is only natural, though,
':rce it is difficult to take in all possible pros and cons. Inter-
=.tingly, had other frames been used to tout the car, we might
.--rr-e decided very differently.
Authors are conscious framers, too. A crime novel would
--t rather dull if from page one, the murder were shown as it
::appened-stab by stab, as it were. Even though we eventually
jiscover the motives and murder weapons, the novelist'sifram-
::g injects thrills and suspense into the story.
In conclusion: Realize that whatever you communicate
:rntains some element of framing, and that every fact-even
:: r'ou hear it from a trusted friend or read it in a reputable
:ervspaper-is subject to this effect, too. Even this chapter.
