reached zero did group B respond differently than group A. To
us, 0 percent risk seems infinitely better than a (highly improb-
able) 1 percent risk.
To test this, let's examine two methods of treating drink-
ing water. Suppose a river has two equally large tributaries.
One is treated using method A, which reduces the risk of dy-
ing from contaminated water from 5 percent to 2 percent. The
other is treated using method B, which reduces the risk from
1 percent to 0 percent, that is, the threat is completely elimi-
nated. So, method A or B? If you think like most people, you
will opt for method B-which is silly because with measure A,
3 percent fewer people die, and with B, just 1 percent fewer.
Method A is three times as good! This fallacy is called the
"zero-risk bias."
A classic example of this is the U.S. Food Act of 1958,
which prohibits food that contains cancer-causing substances.
Instituted to achieve zero risk of cancer, this ban sounds good
at first, but it ended up leading to the use of more danger-
ous (but noncarcinogenic) food additives. It is also absurd: As
Paracelsus illustrated in the sixteenth century, poisoning is
always a question of dosage. Furthermore, this 1aw can never
be enforced propef since it is impossible to remove the last
"banned" molecule from food. Each farm would have to func-
tion like a hyper-sterile computer-chip factorfi and the cost of
food would increase a hundredfold. Economically, zero risk
rarely makes sense. One exception is when the consequences
are colossal, such as a deadiy, highly contagious virus escaping
from a biotech laboratory.
We have no intuitive grurp of risk and thus distinguish
poorly among different threats. The more serious the threat and
