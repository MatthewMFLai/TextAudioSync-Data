The Art of Thinking Ci,earlv

from a particulaf dangerous c1iffin South Africa. This single
event was enough to eradicate a theory confirmed a thousand
times over.
Inductive thinking can have devastating results. Yet we can-
not do without it. We trust that, when we board a plane, aero-
dynamic laws will still be valid. We imagine that we will not
be randomly beaten up on the street. We expect that our hearts
will still be beating tomorrow. These are confidences without
which we could not live, but we must remember that certainties
are always provisional. As Benjamin Franklin said, "Nothing is
certain but death and taxes."
Induction seduces us and leads us to conclusions such as:
"Mankind has always survived, so we will be able to tackle
any future challenges, too." Sounds good in theory, but what
we fail to reahze is that such a statement can only come from a
species that has lasted until now. To assume that our existence
to date is an indication of our future survival is a serious flaw in
reasoning. Probably the most serious of all.
