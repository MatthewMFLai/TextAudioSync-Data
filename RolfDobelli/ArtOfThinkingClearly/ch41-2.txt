?he Art of Thinking Clearly

intuitive thinking draws conclusions rong before the conscious
mind does. For example, I experienced this after the 9/11 at-
tacks on the world Tiade center. I wanted to take out travel
insurance and came across a firm that ofi,'ered special "terrorism
cover." Although other policies protected against all possible
incidents (including terrorism), I automatically fell for the of-
fer. The high point of the whole farce was that I was willing to
pay even more for this enticing yet redundant add_on.
In conclusion: Forget about left brains and right brains: The
difference between intuitive and conscious thinking is much
more significant. With important decisions, remember that,
at the intuitive level, we have a soft spot for plausible stories.
Therefore, be on the lookout for convenient details and happy
endings. Remember: If an additional condition has to be met,
no matter how plausible it sounds, it will become less, not
more,likely.
