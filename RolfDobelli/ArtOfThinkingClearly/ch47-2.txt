A classic victim of the selfselection bias. OnLy someone who i=
alive can make such an observation. Nonentities generally don':
consider their nonexistence for too long. And yet precisely the
same delusion forms the basis of at least a dozen philosophers'
books, as they marvel year rr.., year out at the development oi
language. I'm quite sympathetic to their amaz,ement, but it i'
simply not justified. If language did not exist, philosophers
could not revere it at all-in fact, there would be no philoso-
phers. The miracle of language is tangible only in the environ-
ment in which it exists.
Particularly amusing is this recent telephone survey: A
company wanted to find out, on average, how many phone-.
(landline and ceil) each household owned. When the results
were tallied, the firm was amazed that not a single householi
claimed to have no phone. What a masterpiece.
