Stumped by a Sheet of paper
Exponential Growth

piece of paper is folded in two, then in half again, and
again and again. How thickwill it be after frftyfolds?
Write down your guess before you continue reading.

Second task. Choose between these options: (a) Over the
next thirty days, I will give you $1,000 a day. (b) Over the next
thirty days, I will give you a cent on the first day, two cents on
the second day, four cents on the third day, eight cents on the
iburth day, and so on. Dont think too long about it: A or B?
Are you ready? Well, ifwe assume that a sheet of copy paper
is approximately 0.004 inches thick, then its thickness after
trfty folds is a little over sixty million mires. This equals the
distance between the earth and the sun, as you can check easily
rvith a calculator. with the second question, it is worthwhile
choosing option B, even though A sounds more tempting. Se-
lecting A earns you $30,000 in thirty days; choosing B gives
l-ou more than $5 million.
Linear growth we understand intuitively. However, we have
no sense of exponential (or percentage) growth. Why is this?
Because we didn't need it before. our ancestors' experiences
