ack, a ohotographer, is on the go from Monday to F: -
day. Commissioned by fashion magazines, he divide s :-
time between Milan, Paris, and New York and is c-:'

stantly in search of the most beautiful girls, the most origi:-
designs, and the perfect iight. He is well known on the so;-
circuit, and the moneyis great: $500 an hour, easy. "That'. .'
