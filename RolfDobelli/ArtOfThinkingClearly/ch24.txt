The Inevitability of Unlikely Events
Coincidence

t7:1.5 p.m. on March 1,,1950, the fifteen members of
the church choir in Beatrice, Nebraska, were sched-
uled to meet for rehearsal. For various reasons, they

were all running late. The minister's familywas delayed because
his wife still had to iron their daughter's dress. One couple was
held back when their car wouldn't start. The pianist wanted to
be there thirty minutes early, but he fell into a deep sleep after
dinner. And so on. At 7:25 p.m., the church exploded. The
blast was heard all around the village. It blew out the walls and
sent the roof crashing to the ground. Miraculously, nobodywas
killed. The fire chief traced the explosion back to a gas leak,
even though members of the choir were convinced they had
received a sign from God. Hand of God or coincidence?
Something last week made me think of my old school friend,
Andy, whom I hadn't spoken to in a long time. Suddenly the
phone rang. I picked it up, and, 1o and behold, it was Andy.
"1 must be telepathic!" I exclaimed excitedly. But telepathy or
coincidence? \
