In just a few days, it could cover the whole planet, but since it
consumes more oxygen and sugar than is available, its growth
has a cutoffpoint.
The ancient Persians were well aware that people struggled
,,vith percentage growth. Here is a local tale: There was once
a wise courtier who presented the king with a chessboard.
]{oved by the gift, the king said to him: "Tell me how I can
rhank you." "Your highness, I want nothing more than for you
:o cover the chess board with rice, putting one grain of rice on
:he first square, and then on every subsequent square, twice
:he previous number of grains." The king was astonished: "It is
:n honor to you, dear courtier, that you present such a modest
:equest." But how much rice is that? The king guessed about a
.ack. Only when his servants began the task-placing a grain
rn the first square, two grains of rice on the second square, four
:rains of rice on the third, and so on-did he rcalize that he
'.,.-ould need more rice than was growing on eafth.
When it comes to growth rates, do not trust your intuition.
i ou don't have any. Accept it. What really helps is a calculator
::. with low growth rates, the magic number of 70.
