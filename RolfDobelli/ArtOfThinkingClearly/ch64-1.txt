Do you recognize yourself? On a scale from 1 (poor) to '
(excellent), how was my assessment?
ln 1948, psychologist Bertram Forer crafted this exact pa:-
sage using astrology columns from various magazines. He the :--
gave tt to his students to read, suggesting that each pers.:
was getting a personalized assessment. On average, the st'--
dents rated their characterizations 4.3 out of 5, that is, th."
gave Forer an accuracy score of 86 Percent. The experiment \\.'l
repeated hundreds of times in the decades that followed u-::.'
virtually identical results.
Most likely you gave the text a 4 or 5, too. People tend :
identify many of their own traits in such universal descriptio:,
Science labels this tendency the Forer efect (or the "Barnu:-'
effect"). the Forer ffict explarns why the pseudosciences u'c:.'
so well-astrology, astrotherapy, the study of handwritil-
biorhythm analysis, palmistry, tarot card readings, and s6an:='
with the dead.
What's behind the Forer effect? Ftrst, the majority of sta:.-
ments in Forer's passage are so general that they relate to e'' -
eryone: "sometimes you seriously doubt your actions." \\-:-.
doesn't? Second, we tend to accept flattering statements t:.-
don't apply to us: "You are proud of your independent thi:.:-
ing." ObviouslylWho sees himself or herself as a mindless : --
lower? Third, the so-calledfeature-positive efect plays a p.:
The text contains no negative statements; it states onlywhat ''',
are, even though the absence ofcharacteristics is an equallr'i:
portant part of a person's makeup. Fourth, the father of all :: -
fallacies, the confrmation bias: We accept whatever corresPo:- -'
to our self:image and unconsciorlsly filter everything else o'..:
What remains is a coherent portrait.
