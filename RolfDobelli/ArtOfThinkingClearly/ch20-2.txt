?he Art *f Thinking Clearly

this particular operation. For now it is enough to know that,
with an average surgeon, there is a 33 percent chance that no
one will die, a 4l percent chance that one person will die, and
a 20 percent chance that two people will die. Thatt a simple
probability calculation. What stands out: There is no huge dii
ference between zero dead and two dead. To assess the three
surgeons purely on the basis of the outcomes would be not only
negligent, but also unethical.
In conclusion: Never judge a decision purely by its result,
especially when randomness and "external factors" play a role,
A bad result does not automatically indicate a bad decision and
vice versa. So rather than tearing your hair out about a wrong
decision, or applauding yourself for one that may have only co-
incidentally led to success, remember why you chose what you
did. Were your reasons rational and understandable? Then you
would do well to stick with that method, even if you didn,t
strike it lucky last time.
