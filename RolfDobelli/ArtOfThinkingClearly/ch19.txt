The Dubious Effi.cacyof Doctors, Consultants,

and Psychotherapists
Regression to Mean

is back pain was sometimes better, sometimes worse.
There were days when he felt like he could move
mountains, and those when he could barely move.

if that was the case-fortunately it happened only rarely-his
ivife would drive him to the chiropractor. The next day he felt
much more mobile and recommended the therapist to every-
one.

Another man, younger and with a respectable golf handi-
cap of L2, gushed in a similar fashion about his golf instructor.
Whenever he played miserably, he booked an hour with the
pro, and, 1o and behold, in the next game he fared much better.
A third man, an investment adviser at a major bank, in-
vented a sort of "rain dance" that he performed in the rest-
room every time his stocks had performed extremely badly. As
absurd as it seemed, he felt compelled to do it: Things always
improved afterward.
What links the three men is a fallacy: the regression-to-mean
delusion.
