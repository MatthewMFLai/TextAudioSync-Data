Recently I read that students get better grades at school if
their homes contain a lot of books. This study was surely a shot
in the arm for booksellers, but it is another fine example of fake
causality. The simple truth is that educated parents tend to value
their children's education more than uneducated ones do. Plus.
educated parents often have more books at home. In short, a
dust-covered copy of War and Peace alone isn't going to influ-
ence anyone's grades; what counts is parents' education levels,
as well as their genes.
The best exampie of false causality was the supposed rela-
tionship between the birth rate and the numbers of stork pairs
in Germany. Both were in decline, and if you plot them on a
graph, the two lines of development from 1965 to 1987 ap-
peared almost identical. Does this mean the stork actually does
bring babies? Obviously not, since this was a purely coinciden-
ta1 correlation.
In conclusion: Correlation is not causality. Take a closer
look at linked events: Sometimes what is presented as the cause
turns out to be the effect, and vice versa. And sometimes there
is no link at all-just like with the storks and babies.
