Whatever tricks astrologers and palm readers can turn,
consultants and analysts can, too: "The stock has significant
growth potential, even in a yery competitive environment.
The company lacks the necessary impetus to fully realize and
implement ideas from the development team. Management is
made up of experienced industry professionals; however, hints
ofbureaucratization are noticeable. A look at the profit and loss
statement clearly shows that savings can be made. We advise
the company to focus even more closely on emerging econo-
mies to secure future market share." Sounds about right, noi
How do you rate the quality of such a guru-for example,
an astrologer? Pick twenty people and secretly assign each a
number. Have him characterize the people and write his assess-
nents down on cards. To ensure anonymity, participants never
ind out their numbers. Afterward, each receives a copy of all
:he cards. Only when the majority of people identify "their"
jescription is there real talent at hand. I am still waiting.
