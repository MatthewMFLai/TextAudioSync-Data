to pay their final offer. How high will you go? From your per-
spective, it makes sense to pay fi20, $30, or $40. Your opponent
does the same. Even $99 seems like a reasonable offer for a
$100 bil1. Now, your competitor offers $100. If this remains the
highest bid, he will come away breaking even (paying $100 for
$100), whereas you will simply have to cough up $99. So you
continue to bid. At $110, you have a guaranteed loss of $10, but
your opponent would have to shell out $109 (his last bid). So
he will continue piaying. When do you stop? When will your
competitor give up? Try it out with friends.
In conclusion: Accept this piece of wisdom about auctions
from Warren Buffett: "Donk go." If you happen to work in an
industry where they are inevitable, set a maximum price and
deduct 20 percent from this to offset the llinner's curse.Write
this number on a piece of paper and don't go a cent over it.
