Why Evil Is More Striking Than Good

Loss Aversion

n a scale of 1 to 10, how good do you feel today?
Now consider what would bring you up to a perfect
10. That vacation in the Caribbean you've always

dreamed of? A step up the career ladder, maybe? Next ques-
tion: What would make you drop down by the same number
of points? Paralysis, Alzheimer's, cancer, depression, war,
hunger, torture, financial ruin, damage to your reputation,
losing your best friend, your children getting kidnapped,
blindness, death? The long list of possibilities makes us re-
alize just how many obstacles to happiness exist; in short,
there are more bad things than good-and they are far more
consequential.
In our evolutionary past, this was even more the case. One
stupid mistake and you were dead. Everything could lead to
rour rapid departure from the game of life-carelessness on
rhe hunt, an inflamed tendon, exclusion from the group, and
io on. People who were reckless or gung ho died before they
could pass their genes on to the next generation. Those who
remained, the cautious, survived. We are their descendants.
