Don't Cling to Things
Endowment Effect

he BMW gleamed in the parking lot of the used-car
dealership. Although it had a few miles on the odom-
eter, it looked in perfect condition. I know a little

:.bout used cars, and to me, it was worth around $40,000.
However, the salesman was pushing for $50,000 and wouldn't
budge a dime. When he called the next week to say he would
ircept $40,000 after all,I went for it. The next day, I took it
:ut for a spin and stoppe d at a gas station. The owner came
rut to admire the car-and proceeded to offer me $53,000 in
;a;h on the spot. I politely declined. Only on the way home
jid I realize how ridiculous I was to have said no. Something
:hat I considered worth $40,000 had passed into my posses-
;ion and suddenly taken on a value of more than $53,000. If
I rrere thinking purely rationally, I would have sold the car
::rmediately. But, alas, I'd fallen under the influence of the
p:doument efect.We consider things to be more valuable the
=oment we own them. In other words, ifwe are selling some-
:ning, we charge more for it than what we ourselves would be
n illing to spend.
