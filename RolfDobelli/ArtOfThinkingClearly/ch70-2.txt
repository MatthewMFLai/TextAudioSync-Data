I've often wondered why advertising works at all. Any logi-
cal person must recognize ads for what they are, and suitably
categorize and disqualify them. But even you as a discerning
and intelligent reader wont always succeed at this. Itt quite
possible that, after a few weeks, you won't remember if you
picked up certain information from a well-researched article or
from a tacky advertorial.
How can you thwart the sleeper efect? Ftst, don't accept any
unsolicited advice, even if it seems well meant. Doing so, you
protect yourself to a certain degree from manipulation. Second,
avoid ad-contaminated sources like the plague. How fortunate
we are that books are (sti11) ad-free! Third, try to remember the
source of every argument you encounter. Whose opinions are
these? And why do they think that way? Probe the issue like an
investigator would: Cui bono? Who bene6ts? Admittedlll this
is a 1ot of work and will slow down your decision making. But
it will also refine it.
