?he J\rt *:rf Thinking Clearly

thirty months in prison for fraud. Case 2 (scheduled for 7:27
p.m): a Jew sentenced to sixteen months for assault. Case 3
(scheduled for 3:10 p.m): a Jew sentenced to sixteen monthe
for assault. Case 4 (scheduled for 4:35 p.m.), an Arab sentenced
to thirty months for fraud. How did the judges decide? Morc
significant than the detainees' allegiance or the severity of their
crimes was the judges' decisionfatigue.lhejudges granted re-
quests 1 and 2 because their blood sugar was sti1l high (from
breakfast or lunch). However, they struck out applications 3
and 4 because they could not summon enough energy to ri*.
the consequences ofan early release. Th"y took the easy optim
(the status quo) and the men remained in jail. A study of hun-
dreds of verdicts shows that within a session, the percentage d
"courageous"judicial decisions gradually drops from 65 percem
to almost zero, and after a recess, returns to 65 percent. So
much for the careful deliberations of LadyJustice. But, as lory
as you have no upcoming trials, al1is not lost: You now knor
when to present your project to the CEO.
