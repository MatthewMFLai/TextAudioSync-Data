?he Art of ?hinking Ci*arly

The same is true for commerce on a smaller scale: The wort
off a company is, the greater the talk of the CEO. The extn
chatter extends to not just a 1ot of talking, but to hyperactivitr
also designed to mask the hardship. A laudable exception is &e
former CtrO of General Electric Jack Welch. He once said in
an interview: "You would not believe how difficult it is to bc
simple and clear. People are afraid that they may be seen as t
simpleton. In reality, just the opposite is true."
In conclusion: Verbal expression is the mirror of the mind-
Clear thoughts become clear statements, whereas ambiguous
ideas transform into vacant ramblings. The trouble is that, in
many cases, we lack very lucid thoughts. The world is com-
plicated, and it takes a great deal of mental effort to under-
stand even one facet of the whole. Until you experience such rn
epiphany, it's better to heed Mark Thain: "If you have nothing
to say, say nothing." Simplicity is the zenith of a long, arduorr
journey, not the starting point.
