T'he .4ri of ?hinking Ciearly

vival strategy. Following the crowd has saved our butts mort
often in the past hundred thousand years than striking out m.
our own. With the false-consensus efect, no outside influencm
are involved. Despite this, it still has a social function, whicr
is why evolution didnt eliminate it. Our brain is not built tn
rccognize the truth; instead, its goal is to leave behind as maur
offspring as possible. Whoever seemed courageous and con-
vincing (thanks to the false-consensus efect) created a positime
impression, attracted a disproportionate amount of resources.
and thus increased their chances of passing on their Senes B
future generations. Doubters were less sexy.
In conclusion: Assume that your worldview is not borm
by the public. More than that: Do not assume that those utn
think differently are idiots. Before you distrust them, question
your own assumptions.
