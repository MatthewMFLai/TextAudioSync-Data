How will the world look in fifty years? In his latest book,
Antifragile, Nassim Taleb gives us a clue: Assume that most of
the technology that has existed for the past fifty years will serve
us for another half century. And assume that recent technol-
ogy will be pass6 in a few years' time. Why? Think of these
inventions as if they were species: Whatever has held its own
throughout centuries of innovation will probably continue to
do so in the future, too. Old technology has proven itself; it
possesses an inherent logic even if we do not always under-
stand it. If something has endured for epochs, it must be worth
its salt. You can take this to heart the next time you are in
a strategy meeting. Fifty years into the future will look a lot
like today. Of course, you will witness the birth of many flashy
gadgets and magic contraptions. But most will be short-lived.
When contemplating the future, we place far too much em-
phasis on flavor-oFthe-month inventions and the latest "killer
apps" while underestimating the role of traditional technology.
in the 1960s, space travel was all the rage, so we imagined
ourselves on school trips to Mars. In the '70s, plastic was in, so
rve mulled over how we would furnish our see-through houses.
faleb traces this tendency back to the neomaniapitfall: the ma-
nia for all things shiny and new.
In the past, I sympathized with so-called early adopters, the
:reed of people who cannot survive without the latest iPhone.
I thought they were ahead of their time. Now I regard them as
:rrational and suffering from a kind of sickness: neornanitt. To
:hem, it is of minor importance if an invention provides tan-
:ible benefits; novelty matters more.
