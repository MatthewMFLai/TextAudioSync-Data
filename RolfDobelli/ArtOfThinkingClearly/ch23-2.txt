Sotheby's thrive on this. A person who bids until rre .::j --:

ressful bidder turns out to be the economic loser when he gets
;aught up in the fervor and overbids. I'll offer more insight on

There's a similar effect in the job market. If you are applying
rcr ajob and dont get a call back, you have every reason to be
Jisappointed. However, ifyou make it to the final stages of the
selection process and then receive the rejection, the disappoint-
ment can be much bigger-irrationally. Either you ger the job
rr you don't; nothing else should matter.
In conclusion: Dont cling to things. Consider your prop-
:rty something that the "universe" (whatever you believe this to
:e) has bestowed to you temporarily. Keep in mind that it can
:ecoup this (or more) in the blink of an eye.
