The Difference between Risk and Uncertainty

wo boxes. Box A contains one hundred balls: fifty red
and fifty black. Box B also holds one hundred balls,
but you dont know how many are red and how many

are black. If you reach into one of the boxes without looking
and draw out a red ball, you win $100. Which box will you
choose: A or B? The majority will opt for A.
Let's play again, using exactly the same boxes. This time,
you win $100 if you draw out a black ball. Which box will you
go for now? Most likely you'll choose A again. But that's illogi-
cal! In the first round, you assumed that B contained fewer red
balls (and more black balls), so, rationally, you would have to
opt for B this time around.
Don't worry; you're not alone in this error-quite the op-
posite. This result is known as the "Ellsberg Paradox"-named
after Daniel Ellsberg, a former Harvard psychologist. (As a
side note, he later leaked the top-secret Pentagon Papers to the
press, leading to the downfall of President Nixon.) The Ells-
berg Paradox offers empirical proof that we favor known prob-
abilities (box A) over unknown ones (box B).
