Why Money Is Not Naked
House-Money Effect

windy fall day in the early 1980s. The wet leaves
swirled about the sidewalk. Pushing my bike up the
hill to school, I noticed a strange leaf at my feet. It was

big and rust-brown, and only when I bent down did I realize
it was a 500-Swiss franc bill! That was the equir.alent of about
3250 back then, an absolute fortune for a high school student.
The money spent little time in my pocket: I soon bought myself
a top-of:the-range bike with disc brakes and Shimano gears,
one of the best models around. The funny thing was my old
bike worked fine.
Admittedly, I wasn't completely broke back then: I had man-
aged to save up a few hundred francs through mowing grass in
the neighborhood. Howeveq it never crossed my mind to spend
this hard-earned money on something so unnecessary. The most
I treated myself to was a trip to the movies every now and then.
It was only upon reflection thatl realized how irrational my be-
havior had been. Money is money, after all. But we dont see it
that way. Depending on how we get it, we treat it differently.
\{oney is not naked; it is wrapped in an emotional shroud.
