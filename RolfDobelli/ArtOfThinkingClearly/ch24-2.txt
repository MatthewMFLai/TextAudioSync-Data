Let's apply the same thinking to the phone call. Keep in
mind the many occasions when 'Andy" thinks of you but
doesn't call; when you think of him and he doesn't call; when
you don't think of him and he calls; when he doesn't think
of you and you call. . . . fhere is an almost infinite number
of occasions when you don't think of him and he doesn't cail'
But since people spend about 90 Percent of their time thinking
about others, it is not unlikely that, eventually, two people will
think of each other and one of them will pick up the phone'
And it must not be just Andy: If you have a hundred other
friends, the probability of this happening increases manifold'
We tend to stumble when estimating probabilities. If some-
one says "never," I usually register this as a minuscule probabil-
ity greater than zero since "never" cannot be compensated by a
negative probabilitY.
In sum: Let's not get too excited. Improbable coincidences
are precisely that: rare but very possible events. It's not surpris-
ing when they finally happen. What would be more surprising
is if they never came to be.
