How likely are stories like that? The Swiss psychiatrist C. G.
i-::g saw in them the work of an unknown force, which he called
s-":chronicity. But how should a rationally minded thinker ap-
:,:rach these accounts? Preferably with a piece of paper and
i :encil. Consider the first case, the explosion of the church.
)lv four boxes to represent each of the potential events. The
::.1possibility is what actually took place: "choir delayed and
::-:rch exploded." But there are three other options: ,,choir de-
;--:d and church did not explode," "choir on time and church
:x:loded," and "choir on time and church did not exp1ode.,,
;.:imate the frequencies of these events and write them in
:-ri corresponding box. Pay special attention to how often the
.,."i: case has happened: Every day, millions of choirs gather for
-::eduled rehearsals and their churches don't blow up. Sud-
:r::1r', the story has lost its unimaginable quality. For al1 these
:::liions of churches, it would be improbable if something like
*::.it happened in Beatrice, Nebraska, didn't take place at least
;r,re a century. So, no hand of God. (And znyway,why would
