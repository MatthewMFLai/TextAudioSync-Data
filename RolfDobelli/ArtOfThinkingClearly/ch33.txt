the performance of horses rn7973. He concluded
that the power of two animals pulling a coach did

not equal twice the power of a single horse. Surprised by this

pull a rope and measured the force applied by each individual.
On average, if two people were pulling together, each invested
just 93 percent of his individual strength, when three pulled to-
gether, it was 85 percent, and with eight people, just 49 percent.
