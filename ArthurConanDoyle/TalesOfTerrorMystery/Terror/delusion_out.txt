In reading the history of nations, we find that, like individuals(個人的，個體的), they have their whims(奇想，怪念頭；幻想) and their peculiarities(奇特，古怪); their seasons of excitement(刺激；興奮，激動) and recklessness(魯莽，輕率，不顧一切), when they care not what they do. We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad(發瘋的，發狂的) in its pursuit(追求，尋求); that millions of people become simultaneously(同時地) impressed(給……極深的印象；使感動) with one delusion(迷惑，欺騙), and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly(愚蠢；愚笨) more captivating(令人神魂顛倒的) than the first. We see one nation suddenly seized(抓住；捉住), from its highest to its lowest members, with a fierce desire of military glory; another as suddenly becoming crazed(瘋狂的；醉心的) upon a religious scruple(顧慮，顧忌，良心上的不安); and neither of them recovering its senses until it has shed(流出；流下) rivers of blood and sowed(散布，傳播) a harvest of groans(呻吟聲；哼聲) and tears, to be reaped(收割；收穫) by its posterity(後裔，子孫).
