Title: A CHRISTMAS CAROL(聖誕頌歌)

Author: Charles Dickens

STAVE(詩節) I  MARLEYS GHOST

MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial(葬禮) was signed(簽署) by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker(殯儀員), and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge(學問), what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery(五金器具) in the trade. But the wisdom(智慧) of our ancestors(祖先) is in the simile(明喻); and my unhallowed(不神聖的) hands shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically(堅決的), that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise(不然)? Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge was his sole(唯一的) executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary(剩餘的) legatee(遺產受贈人), his sole friend, and sole mourner(哀悼者). And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully(非常糟糕) cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised(隆重舉行儀式) it with an undoubted bargain(討價還價).

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly(明顯的) understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate(敍述). If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable(引人注目的) in his taking a stroll(散步) at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts(防禦土牆), than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly(魯莽的) turning out after dark in a breezy(清風習習) spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance-- literally to astonish(使驚訝) his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.

Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching(猛扭), grasping(貪婪的), scraping(削去), clutching(掌控), covetous(垂涎的), old sinner(罪過)! Hard and sharp as flint(火石), from which no steel(鋼) had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary(單獨的) as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped(捏) his pointed nose, shrivelled(乾枯) his cheek, stiffened(變僵硬) his gait(步履); made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly(精明的) in his grating(刺耳的) voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry(瘦而結實的) chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw(解凍) it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence(影響) on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry(冬天的) weather chill(冷卻) him. No wind that blew was bitterer(極為不滿的) than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting(連續投擲) rain less open to entreaty(懇求). Foul(惡劣的) weather didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail(冰雹), and sleet(霙), could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often "came down" handsomely(大量的), and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome(高興的) looks, "My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?" No beggars(乞丐) implored(懇求) him to bestow(贈予) a trifle(鮮奶油鬆糕), no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired(訊問) the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug(拖) their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag(搖) their tails as though they said, "No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!"

But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy(同情) to keep its distance, was what the knowing(會意的) ones call "nuts(愚蠢的)" to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak(寒冷的), biting weather: foggy(有霧的) withal(加之): and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing(發出呼哧呼哧聲) up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping(（重踩) their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already-- it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring(相鄰的) offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable(觸摸得到的) brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink(縫隙) and keyhole, and was so dense without(在……外面), that although the court was of the narrowest(狹窄的), the houses opposite were mere(僅僅的) phantoms(幽靈). To see the dingy(暗淡的) cloud come drooping(下垂) down, obscuring(混淆) everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal(煤). But he couldn't replenish(補充) it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely(確實) as the clerk came in with the shovel(鏟), the master predicted(預計) that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore(因此) the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.

"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!" cried a cheerful(興高采烈的) voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew(外甥), who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation(親密的) he had of his approach.

"Bah!" said Scrooge, "Humbug!"

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow(發光); his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled(閃耀), and his breath smoked again.

"Christmas a humbug, uncle!" said Scrooge's nephew. "You don't mean that, I am sure?"

"I do," said Scrooge. "Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough."

"Come, then," returned the nephew gaily(歡樂地). "What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose(孤僻的)? You're rich enough."

Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment(無準備的), said, "Bah!" again; and followed it up with "Humbug."

"Don't be cross(生氣的), uncle!" said the nephew.

"What else can I be," returned the uncle, "when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will," said Scrooge indignantly(憤怒的), "every idiot(白癡) who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake(樁) of holly through his heart. He should!"

"Uncle!" pleaded(懇求) the nephew.

"Nephew!" returned the uncle sternly(嚴厲地), "keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine."

"Keep it!" repeated Scrooge's nephew. "But you don't keep it."

"Let me leave it alone, then," said Scrooge. "Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!"

"There are many things from which I might have derived(從…中得到) good, by which I have not profited(盈利), I dare say," returned the nephew. "Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round--apart from the veneration(尊重) due to its sacred(神聖的) name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable(慈善的), pleasant(令人愉快的) time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent(同意) to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore(因此), uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!"

The clerk in the Tank involuntarily(不由自主的) applauded(讚許). Becoming immediately sensible(覺察到的) of the impropriety(不適當的行為), he poked(戳) the fire, and extinguished(熄滅) the last frail(脆弱的的) spark(火花) for ever.

"Let me hear another sound from you," said Scrooge, "and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation(職位)! You're quite a powerful speaker, sir," he added, turning to his nephew. "I wonder you don't go into Parliament."

"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine(吃晚飯) with us to-morrow."

Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity(盡頭的) first.

"But why?" cried Scrooge's nephew. "Why?"

"Why did you get married?" said Scrooge.

"Because I fell in love."

"Because you fell in love!" growled(發出低沉的吼叫) Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous(荒唐的) than a merry Christmas. "Good afternoon!"

"Nay(不僅如此), uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?"

"Good afternoon," said Scrooge.

"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?"

"Good afternoon," said Scrooge.

"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute(堅決的). We have never had any quarrel(爭吵), to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage(敬意) to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour(幽默) to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!"

"Good afternoon!" said Scrooge.

"And A Happy New Year!"

"Good afternoon!" said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings(問候) of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially(誠摯的).

"There's another fellow(傢伙)," muttered(低聲嘀咕) Scrooge; who overheard him: "my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam."

This lunatic(瘋子), in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people in. They were portly(發福的) gentlemen, pleasant to behold(注視), and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed(彎腰曲背的) to him.

"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. "Have I the pleasure of addressing(對……說話) Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"

"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," Scrooge replied. "He died seven years ago, this very night."

"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented(作為…的代言人) by his surviving(倖存的) partner," said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous(不祥的) word "liberality(開放的)," Scrooge frowned(皺眉), and shook his head, and handed the credentials(資格證書) back.

"At this festive(節日的) season of the year, Mr. Scrooge," said the gentleman, taking up a pen, "it is more than usually desirable(渴望獲得的) that we should make some slight provision(食物供給) for the Poor and destitute(赤貧的), who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries(必需品); hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts(舒適的設施), sir."

"Are there no prisons(監獄)?" asked Scrooge.

"Plenty of prisons," said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.

"And the Union workhouses?" demanded(強烈要求) Scrooge. "Are they still in operation?"

"They are. Still," returned the gentleman, "I wish I could say they were not."

"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour(力量), then?" said Scrooge.

"Both very busy, sir."

"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course," said Scrooge. "I'm very glad to hear it."

"Under the impression(印象) that they scarcely(幾乎不) furnish(佈置) Christian cheer(喝彩) of mind or body to the multitude(眾多的人)," returned the gentleman, "a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly(強烈地) felt, and Abundance(大量) rejoices(深感欣喜). What shall I put you down for?"

"Nothing!" Scrooge replied.

"You wish to be anonymous(匿名的)?"

"I wish to be left alone(單獨)," said Scrooge. "Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry(快樂的) myself at Christmas and I can't afford(提供) to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments(機構) I have mentioned--they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there."

"Many can't go there; and many would rather die."

"If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had better do it, and decrease the surplus(過剩) population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that."

"But you might know it," observed the gentleman.

"It's not my business," Scrooge returned. "It's enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere(妨礙) with other people's. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!"

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue(追求) their point, the gentlemen withdrew(撤離). Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious(不問場合亂講話的) temper(脾氣) than was usual with him.

Meanwhile(（與此）同時) the fog and darkness thickened(變厚) so, that people ran about with flaring(發光的) links, proffering(提供) their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff(低沉而生硬的) old bell was always peeping(偷看) slily(狡猾地) down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous(微顫的) vibrations afterwards(以後) as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier(火盆), round which a party of ragged(衣衫襤褸的) men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking(眨眼示意) their eyes before the blaze(火焰) in rapture(興高采烈). The water-plug being left in solitude(獨處), its overflowings sullenly(悶悶不樂的) congealed(凝固), and turned to misanthropic(厭惡人類的) ice. The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs(帶葉小枝) and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy(紅潤的) as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant(華麗的展示), with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull(（無光澤的) principles as bargain(便宜貨) and sale had anything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers(男管家) to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household should; and even the little tailor(裁縫), whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty(嗜血的) in the streets, stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret(閣樓), while his lean wife and the baby sallied(急忙趕去) out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing(穿透的), searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar(熟悉的) weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty(強而有力的) purpose. The owner of one scant(不足的) young nose, gnawed(嚙) and mumbled(咕噥著說) by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole(鎖匙孔) to regale(使愉悅) him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of


        "God bless you, merry gentleman! 
         May nothing you dismay!"

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial(怡人的) frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted(下車) from his stool, and tacitly(默示的) admitted the fact to the expectant(期待的) clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed(吹滅) his candle out, and put on his hat.

"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?" said Scrooge.

"If quite convenient, sir."

"It's not convenient," said Scrooge, "and it's not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?"

The clerk smiled faintly(略微地).

"And yet," said Scrooge, "you don't think me ill-used, when I pay a day's wages for no work."

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December!" said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. "But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning."

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl(發出低沉的吼叫). The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter(羽絨) dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt(飛跑), to play at blindman's-buff.

Scrooge took his melancholy(憂鬱) dinner in his usual melancholy tavern(小酒館); and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled(使著迷) the rest of the evening with his banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased(亡故者) partner. They were a gloomy(憂鬱) suite(（套房) of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying(想像) it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary(陰鬱的) enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain(高興的) to grope(摸索) with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation(冥想) on the threshold.

Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular(特別的) about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including--which is a bold word--the corporation, aldermen(市議員), and livery(僕人). Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed(給予) one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker(門環), without(沒有) its undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable(不能看透的) shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal(憂鬱茫然的) light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar(地窖). It was not angry or ferocious(兇惡的), but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly(幽靈般的) spectacles(眼鏡) turned up on its ghostly forehead(前額). The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless(靜止的). That, and its livid(暗紫色的) colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly(凝視著) at this phenomenon(現象), it was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled(受驚嚇的), or that his blood was not conscious(意識到) of a terrible sensation(感覺) to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished(放棄), turned it sturdily(牢固的), walked in, and lighted his candle.

He did pause, with a moment's irresolution(猶豫不決的), before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously(細心的) behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail(髮辮) sticking out into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said "Pooh, pooh!" and closed it with a bang(發出巨響).

The sound resounded(回響) through the house like thunder. Every room above, and every cask(圓木桶) in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal(大聲鳴響) of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely(模糊不清的) about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse(靈車) up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades(欄杆): and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom(憂鬱). Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate(金屬爐架); spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan(深平底鍋) of gruel(燕麥粥) (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob(爐盤). Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious(可疑的) attitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker(火杵).

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom(習俗). Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat(領帶); put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged(必須做某事) to sit close to it, and brood(擔憂) over it, before he could extract(提取) the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint(古雅的) Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate(畫插圖) the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed(不連貫的) fragments(碎塊) of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one.

"Humbug(騙局)!" said Scrooge; and walked across the room.

After several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance(一瞥) happened to rest upon a bell, a disused(廢棄) bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber(臥室) in the highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment(驚訝), and with a strange, inexplicable(無法說明的) dread(害怕), that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing(搖晃). It swung so softly in the outset(最初) that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.

This might have lasted(持續) half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased(停止) as they had begun, together. They were succeeded(接替) by a clanking(（使）發出噹啷聲) noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.

The cellar-door flew open with a booming(低沉有回響的聲音) sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.

"It's humbug still!" said Scrooge. "I won't believe it."

His colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped(跳) up, as though it cried, "I know him; Marley's Ghost(幽靈)!" and fell again.

The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels(穗) on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped(抓緊) about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks(扣鎖), ledgers(分類帳), deeds(契約), and heavy purses(錢包) wrought(精煉的) in steel. His body was transparent(透明的); so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat(背心), could see the two buttons on his coat behind.

Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels(腸), but he had never believed it until now.

No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture(質地) of the folded kerchief(方頭巾) bound about its head and chin, which wrapper(包裝紙) he had not observed before; he was still incredulous(不輕信的), and fought against his senses.

"How now!" said Scrooge, caustic(刻薄的) and cold as ever. "What do you want with me?"

"Much!"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.

"Who are you?"

"Ask me who I was."

"Who were you then?" said Scrooge, raising his voice. "You're particular, for a shade." He was going to say "to a shade," but substituted(代之以) this, as more appropriate(恰當的).

"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley."

"Can you--can you sit down?" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully(懷疑的) at him.

"I can."

"Do it, then."

Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity(必要) of an embarrassing(令人尷尬的) explanation. But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.

"You don't believe in me," observed the Ghost.

"I don't," said Scrooge.

"What evidence(證據) would you have of my reality(真實) beyond that of your senses?"

"I don't know," said Scrooge.

"Why do you doubt your senses?"

"Because," said Scrooge, "a little thing affects(影響) them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of gravy(肉汁) than of grave about you, whatever you are!"

Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking(出色的) jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish(淘氣的) then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre(鬼魂)'s voice disturbed the very marrow(骨髓) in his bones.

To sit, staring at those fixed glazed(發呆) eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce(平局) with him. There was something very awful(糟糕的), too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated(鼓動) as by the hot vapour from an oven.

"You see this toothpick?" said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision's stony gaze(盯著) from himself.

"I do," replied the Ghost.

"You are not looking at it," said Scrooge.

"But I see it," said the Ghost, "notwithstanding(儘管)."

"Well!" returned Scrooge, "I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted(煩擾) by a legion of goblins(小妖怪), all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!"

At this the spirit raised a frightful(可怕的) cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling(駭人聽聞的) noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon(暈倒). But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage(繃帶) round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!

Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.

"Mercy(慈悲)!" he said. "Dreadful(可怕的) apparition(鬼魂), why do you trouble me?"

"Man of the worldly(物質的) mind!" replied the Ghost, "do you believe in me or not?"

"I do," said Scrooge. "I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?"

"It is required of every man," the Ghost returned, "that the spirit within him should walk abroad(傳開) among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth(向前) in life, it is condemned(被判死刑的) to do so after death. It is doomed(註定失敗) to wander through the world--oh, woe(不幸) is me!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!"

Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.

"You are fettered(給上腳鐐)," said Scrooge, trembling(顫抖). "Tell me why?"

"I wear the chain I forged(製造) in life," replied the Ghost. "I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded(將…纏在身上) it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?"

Scrooge trembled more and more.

"Or would you know," pursued(追問) the Ghost, "the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous(笨拙的) chain!"

Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms(英尋) of iron cable: but he could see nothing.

"Jacob," he said, imploringly(懇求). "Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!"

"I have none to give," the Ghost replied. "It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed(傳達) by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger(徘徊) anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my spirit never roved(漫遊) beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary(疲倦的) journeys lie before me!"

It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches(半長褲) pockets. Pondering(仔細考慮) on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.

"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob," Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility(謙遜) and deference(尊敬).

"Slow!" the Ghost repeated.

"Seven years dead," mused Scrooge. "And travelling all the time!"

"The whole time," said the Ghost. "No rest, no peace. Incessant(沒完沒了的) torture(折磨) of remorse(懊悔)."

"You travel fast?" said Scrooge.

"On the wings of the wind," replied the Ghost.

"You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years," said Scrooge.

The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously(極醜陋地) in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting(控告) it for a nuisance(麻煩的事物).

"Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed," cried the phantom, "not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal(永生的) creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity(永恆) before the good of which it is susceptible(易受影響的) is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast(廣大的) means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends(作出補償) for one life's opportunity misused(誤用)! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!"

"But you were always a good man of business, Jacob," faltered(畏縮) Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.

"Business!" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. "Mankind was my business. The common welfare(社會福利) was my business; charity(慈善事業), mercy, forbearance(克制), and benevolence(仁慈的), were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive(全面的) ocean of my business!"

It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing(徒勞的) grief(悲痛), and flung it heavily upon the ground again.

"At this time of the rolling year," the spectre said, "I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode(住所)! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!"

Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake(顫抖) exceedingly(非常).

"Hear me!" cried the Ghost. "My time is nearly gone."

"I will," said Scrooge. "But don't be hard upon me! Don't be flowery(華而不實的), Jacob! Pray!"

"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day."

It was not an agreeable(令人愉悅的) idea. Scrooge shivered(發抖), and wiped the perspiration(汗) from his brow(額頭).

"That is no light part of my penance(悔過)," pursued the Ghost. "I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring(獲得), Ebenezer."

"You were always a good friend to me," said Scrooge. "Thank'ee!"

"You will be haunted," resumed the Ghost, "by Three Spirits."

Scrooge's countenance(臉色) fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done.

"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?" he demanded, in a faltering voice.

"It is."

"I--I think I'd rather not," said Scrooge.

"Without their visits," said the Ghost, "you cannot hope to shun(避開) the path I tread(踩，踏). Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls(緩慢而反覆地鳴響) One."

"Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?" hinted(暗示) Scrooge.

"Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate(震動). Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake(利益), you remember what has passed between us!"

When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head, as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural(超自然的) visitor confronting(面對) him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.

The apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.

It beckoned(（向…）點頭或招手) Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces(一步之距) of each other, Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.

Not so much in obedience(服從), as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible(理智的) of confused noises in the air; incoherent(語無倫次的) sounds of lamentation(悲歎) and regret; wailings inexpressibly(難以言傳的) sorrowful(悲痛的) and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge(哀樂); and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.

Scrooge followed to the window: desperate(鋌而走險的) in his curiosity(好奇心). He looked out.

The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither(到這裡) and thither(到那裡) in restless haste(倉促), and moaning(呻吟聲) as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous(醜惡的) iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously(使人憐憫的) at being unable to assist a wretched(不幸的) woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought(尋求) to interfere(介入), for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.

Whether these creatures faded into mist(薄霧), or mist enshrouded(籠罩) them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.

Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts(閂) were undisturbed(未被打擾的). He tried to say "Humbug!" but stopped at the first syllable(音節). And being, from the emotion he had undergone(經歷), or the fatigues(疲憊) of the day, or his glimpse(瞥見) of the Invisible World, or the dull(乏味的) conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose(憩息); went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.
