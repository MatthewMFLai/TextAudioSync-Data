Title: A CHRISTMAS CAROL

Author: Charles Dickens

STAVE III  THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS

AWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously(巨大的) tough snore(打鼾), and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion(時刻) to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time(及時), for the especial(特殊的) purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched(發送) to him through Jacob Marley's intervention(幹預). But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre(幽靈) would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established(設立) a sharp look-out all round the bed. For he wished to challenge(考驗) the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous.

Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume(羽飾) themselves on being acquainted(熟悉的) with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity(能力) for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter(誤殺); between which opposite extremes(極端的), no doubt, there lies a tolerably(在一定程度上) wide and comprehensive range of subjects(主題). Without venturing(冒昧地說) for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros(犀牛) would have astonished(感到震驚的) him very much.

Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling(顫抖). Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze(火焰) of ruddy(紅色的) light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed(宣佈) the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive(擔憂的) that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous(自發的) combustion(燃燒), without having the consolation(安慰) of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament(窘境) who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably(不容置疑的) have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining(毗鄰的) room, from whence(從何處), on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking full possession(佔有) of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled(曳行) in his slippers to the door.

The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade(致意) him enter. He obeyed(服從).

It was his own room. There was no doubt(懷疑) about that. But it had undergone(經歷) a surprising transformation(徹底改觀). The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove(樹叢); from every part of which, bright gleaming(光潔閃亮的) berries glistened(閃耀). The crisp(鬆脆的) leaves of holly, mistletoe(檞寄生）), and ivy(常春藤) reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered(散布的) there; and such a mighty blaze(光輝) went roaring(喧囂的) up the chimney, as that dull petrification(石化) of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped(堆滿的) up on the floor, to form a kind of throne(王座), were turkeys, geese, game(野味), poultry(家禽), brawn(豬頭肉), great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths(環) of sausages(香腸), mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters(蠔), red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious(汁液豐富的) pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething(密集) bowls of punch(潘趣酒), that made the chamber dim with their delicious(美味的) steam. In easy state upon this couch(沙發), there sat a jolly Giant, glorious(輝煌的) to see; who bore a glowing(熱情洋溢的) torch(火炬), in shape not unlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping(窺視) round the door.

"Come in!" exclaimed(呼喊) the Ghost. "Come in! and know me better, man!"

Scrooge entered timidly(膽怯的), and hung his head before this Spirit. He was not the dogged(頑固的) Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.

"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present," said the Spirit. "Look upon me!"

Scrooge reverently(肅然起敬) did so. It was clothed in one simple green robe, or mantle(披風), bordered with white fur. This garment(衣服) hung so loosely(寬鬆地) on the figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining(鄙視) to be warded or concealed(隱藏) by any artifice(詭計). Its feet, observable beneath the ample(充足的) folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles(冰柱). Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial(友好的) face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour(神態舉止), and its joyful air. Girded(將…圍在身上…) round its middle was an antique(古董) scabbard(劍鞘); but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath(鞘) was eaten up with rust.

"You have never seen the like of me before!" exclaimed the Spirit.

"Never," Scrooge made answer to it.

"Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?" pursued(追問) the Phantom.

"I don't think I have," said Scrooge. "I am afraid I have not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?"

"More than eighteen hundred," said the Ghost.

"A tremendous(巨大的) family to provide for!" muttered(低聲嘀咕) Scrooge.

The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.

"Spirit," said Scrooge submissively(順從的), "conduct me where you will. I went forth last night on compulsion(強迫力), and I learnt a lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have aught(任何事物) to teach me, let me profit by it."

"Touch my robe!"

Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.

Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch, all vanished(消失的) instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow(發光), the hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and not unpleasant(令人不快的) kind of music, in scraping(擦去) the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings(住所), and from the tops of their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping(豐滿的) down into the road below, and splitting into artificial little snow-storms.

The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, contrasting(對比的) with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed(耕過的) up in deep furrows(溝) by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons(四輪貨運馬車); furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off; and made intricate(錯綜複雜的) channels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy(憂鬱), and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy(骯髒的) mist, half thawed(融化), half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty(煤煙) atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away to their dear hearts' content. There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness(高興的) abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured(力圖) to diffuse in vain(徒然的).

For, the people who were shovelling(鏟) away on the housetops were jovial(友善快活的) and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets(矮護牆), and now and then exchanging a facetious(亂引人發笑的) snowball--better-natured missile(導彈) far than many a wordy jest-- laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers(家禽販)' shops were still half open, and the fruiterers' were radiant(容光煥發的) in their glory. There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling(懶散地躺) at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic(暴跳如雷的) opulence(豪華的). There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking(使眼色) from their shelves in wanton(無節制的) slyness(狡猾的) at the girls as they went by, and glanced(一瞥) demurely(文靜的) at the hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming(英姿煥發的) pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence(仁慈的) to dangle(垂下) from conspicuous(顯眼的) hooks, that people's mouths might water gratis(無償的) as they passed; there were piles of filberts(榛子), mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance(芳香), ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat(矮胖的) and swarthy(黝黑的), setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating(懇求) and beseeching(哀求) to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping(喘氣) round and round their little world in slow and passionless(無激情的) excitement(興奮).

The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses(一瞥)! It was not alone that the scales descending(降下) on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine(盤繞) and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters(金屬罐) were rattled up and down like juggling(；耍把戲) tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins(葡萄乾) were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon(肉桂) so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently(隨後的) bilious(膽汁分泌過多的). Nor was it that the figs(無花果) were moist and pulpy(漿狀物), or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness(酸的) from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled(跌跌撞撞地走) up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker(柳條編的) baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour(幽默) possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank(坦率的) and fresh that the polished(優雅而又自信的) hearts with which they fastened(扣緊) their aprons(圍裙) behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws(寒鴉) to peck(啄) at if they chose.

But soon the steeples(尖塔) called good people all, to church and chapel(小教堂), and away they came, flocking(聚集) through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest(歡快的) faces. And at the same time there emerged(浮現) from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable(數不清的) people, carrying their dinners to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revellers(作樂) appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled(撒) incense(香) on their dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled(擠) each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored(恢復) directly. For they said, it was a shame to quarrel(爭吵) upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!

In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch(斑點) of wet above each baker's oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.

"Is there a peculiar(古怪的) flavour in what you sprinkle(撒) from your torch?" asked Scrooge.

"There is. My own."

"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?" asked Scrooge.

"To any kindly given. To a poor one most."

"Why to a poor one most?" asked Scrooge.

"Because it needs it most."

"Spirit," said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, "I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp(限制) these people's opportunities(機遇) of innocent(天真的) enjoyment."

"I!" cried the Spirit.

"You would deprive(剝奪) them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all," said Scrooge. "Wouldn't you?"

"I!" cried the Spirit.

"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?" said Scrooge. "And it comes to the same thing."

"I seek!" exclaimed the Spirit.

"Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family," said Scrooge.

"There are some upon this earth of yours," returned the Spirit, "who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds(行為) of passion(激情), pride(自豪), ill-will, hatred(憎恨), envy(忌妒), bigotry(固執己見的人), and selfishness(自私的) in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith(朋友) and kin(家屬), as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge(斥責) their doings on themselves, not us."

Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible(看不見的), as they had been before, into the suburbs(城郊) of the town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstanding(儘管) his gigantic size, he could accommodate(使適應) himself to any place with ease(緩解); and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully(優雅的) and like a supernatural(超自然的) creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty(崇高的) hall.

And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy(同情心) with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold(門檻) of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen "Bob" a-week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed(帶來幸福的) his four-roomed house!

Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons(絲帶), which are cheap and make a goodly(相當大的) show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted(幫助) by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged(將……插入) a fork into the saucepan(深平底鍋) of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar(衣領) (Bob's private property, conferred(授予) upon his son and heir(繼承人) in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced(深感欣喜) to find himself so gallantly attired(衣著), and yearned(渴望) to show his linen(亞麻布) in the fashionable(時尚的) Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking(曬太陽) in luxurious(奢侈的) thoughts of sage(洋蘇草) and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted(得意洋洋的) Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled(剝去皮的).

"What has ever got your precious(寶貴的) father then?" said Mrs. Cratchit. "And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?"

"Here's Martha, mother!" said a girl, appearing as she spoke.

"Here's Martha, mother!" cried the two young Cratchits. "Hurrah! There's such a goose, Martha!"

"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!" said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl(披巾) and bonnet(女裝帽) for her with officious(愛發號施令的) zeal(熱情).

"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night," replied the girl, "and had to clear away this morning, mother!"

"Well! Never mind so long as you are come," said Mrs. Cratchit. "Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord(貴族) bless ye!"

"No, no! There's father coming," cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. "Hide, Martha, hide!"

So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe(蓬邊), hanging down before him; and his threadbare(磨光露底的) clothes darned(縫補) up and brushed, to look seasonable(合時令的); and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas(唉) for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch(T形拐杖), and had his limbs supported by an iron frame(框架)!

"Why, where's our Martha?" cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.

"Not coming," said Mrs. Cratchit.

"Not coming!" said Bob, with a sudden declension(詞類變化) in his high spirits; for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant(不能控制的). "Not coming upon Christmas Day!"

Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely(過早的) from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled(催促) Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding(布丁) singing in the copper.

"And how did little Tim behave?" asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied(復原) Bob on his credulity(輕信), and Bob had hugged(擁抱) his daughter to his heart's content.

"As good as gold," said Bob, "and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful(沉思的), sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple(跛子), and it might be pleasant(親切友好的) to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame(一瘸一拐的) beggars(乞丐) walk, and blind(盲的) men see."

Bob's voice was tremulous(微顫的) when he told them this, and trembled(顫抖) more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty(熱誠的).

His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted(陪同) by his brother and sister to his stool(凳子) before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot mixture(混和) in a jug(壺) with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob(爐盤) to simmer(燉); Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous(似乎無處不在的) young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession(行列).

Such a bustle(熱鬧的活動) ensued(接著發生) that you might have thought a goose the rarest(罕見的) of all birds; a feathered(有羽毛的) phenomenon(現象), to which a black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy(肉汁) (ready beforehand(預先) in a little saucepan) hissing(發嘶嘶聲) hot; Master Peter mashed(搗爛的) the potatoes with incredible(難以置信的) vigour(精力); Miss Belinda sweetened(使變甜) up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed(擠滿的) spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless(氣喘吁吁的) pause(暫停), as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush(湧出) of stuffing issued forth, one murmur(低聲說) of delight(欣喜) arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly(衰弱地) cried Hurrah!

There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness(嫩的) and flavour(味道), size and cheapness, were the themes(題目) of universal(共同的) admiration(讚美). Eked(精打細算地維持) out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient(充足的) dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular(特定的), were steeped in(充滿) sage and onion to the eyebrows(眉頭)! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous(神經質的) to bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.

Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry(興高采烈的) with the goose--a supposition(猜測) at which the two young Cratchits became livid(狂怒的)! All sorts of horrors(毛骨悚然) were supposed.

Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled(布滿斑點的) cannon-ball, so hard and firm(結實的), blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited(燃燒) brandy(白蘭地), and bedight(裝飾) with Christmas holly(冬青) stuck into the top.

Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly(平靜地) too, that he regarded(認為) it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage(結婚). Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess(承認) she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour(小麥粉). Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat heresy(異端邪說) to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed(（臉紅) to hint at such a thing.

At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts(栗子) on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth(壁爐邊), in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow(肘) stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers(杯子), and a custard-cup without a handle.

These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets(無柄高腳杯) would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming(滿面笑容) looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered(發出劈啪聲) and cracked(破裂的) noisily. Then Bob proposed(提議為…乾杯):

"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!"

Which all the family re-echoed.

"God bless us every one!" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.

He sat very close to his father's side upon his little stool. Bob held his withered(枯萎的) little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded(害怕) that he might be taken from him.

"Spirit," said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, "tell me if Tiny Tim will live."

"I see a vacant seat," replied the Ghost, "in the poor chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved(保存). If these shadows remain unaltered(不變的) by the Future, the child will die."

"No, no," said Scrooge. "Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared(饒恕)."

"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my race," returned the Ghost, "will find him here. What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population."

Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted(引述) by the Spirit, and was overcome(使受不了) with penitence(懺悔的) and grief(悲傷).

"Man," said the Ghost, "if man you be in heart, not adamant(固執的), forbear(克制) that wicked cant(虛偽言辭) until you have discovered What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless(無價值的) and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child. Oh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing(斷言) on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!"

Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke(訓斥), and trembling cast(投) his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily(迅速的), on hearing his own name.

"Mr. Scrooge!" said Bob; "I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast(盛宴)!"

"The Founder of the Feast indeed!" cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening(變紅). "I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast(享受) upon, and I hope he'd have a good appetite(胃口) for it."

"My dear," said Bob, "the children! Christmas Day."

"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure," said she, "on which one drinks the health of such an odious(討厭的), stingy(吝嗇的), hard, unfeeling(沒有同情心的) man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!"

"My dear," was Bob's mild answer, "Christmas Day."

"I'll drink his health for your sake(利益) and the Day's," said Mrs. Cratchit, "not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy new year! He'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!"

The children drank the toast(乾杯) after her. It was the first of their proceedings(行為) which had no heartiness(熱誠的). Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn't care twopence(毫不在乎) for it. Scrooge was the Ogre(吃人怪物) of the family. The mention of his name cast(投射) a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled(消除) for full five minutes.

After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier(興高采烈的) than before, from the mere(僅僅的) relief(寬慰) of Scrooge the Baleful(惡毒的) being done with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously(巨大的) at the idea of Peter's being a man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully(考慮周到的) at the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating(慎重考慮) what particular investments he should favour(贊同) when he came into the receipt(收條) of that bewildering(令人不知所措的) income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice(學徒) at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch(一段時間), and how she meant to lie abed(在床上) to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how she had seen a countess(伯爵夫人) and a lord some days before, and how the lord "was much about as tall as Peter;" at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive(傷感的) little voice, and sang it very well indeed.

There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty(缺乏的); and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker(當舖老闆)'s. But, they were happy, grateful(表示感謝的), pleased with one another, and contented(滿足) with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially(尤其) on Tiny Tim, until the last.

By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering(閃爍) of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy(溫馨的) dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness. There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins(堂兄弟), uncles(舅父), aunts(姑母), and be the first to greet(問候) them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling(聚集); and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded(配有風帽的) and fur-booted, and all chattering(喋喋不休) at once, tripped(行程) lightly off to some near neighbour's house; where, woe(不幸) upon the single man who saw them enter--artful witches(女巫), well they knew it--in a glow(容光煥發)!

But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings(聚會), you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted(喜形於色)! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious(容量大的) palm, and floated on, outpouring(流露), with a generous(慷慨的) hand, its bright and harmless mirth(歡樂) on everything within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned(在知識範圍之外) the lamplighter that he had any company(同伴) but Christmas!

And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak(荒涼的) and desert moor(荒野), where monstrous(醜惡的) masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever(無論到哪裡) it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss(苔蘚) and furze(荊豆), and coarse rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak(條紋) of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation(荒涼) for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.

"What place is this?" asked Scrooge.

"A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels(腸) of the earth," returned the Spirit. "But they know me. See!"

A light shone from the window of a hut(小屋), and swiftly(迅速地) they advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud(泥) and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children's children, and another generation beyond that, all decked(裝扮) out gaily(歡樂地) in their holiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling(咆哮的) of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a boy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus(伴唱). So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe(愉快的) and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.

The Spirit did not tarry(逗留) here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped--whither? Not to sea? To sea. To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful(可怕的) range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened(使耳聾) by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns(大洞穴) it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine(損害) the earth.

Built upon a dismal(憂鬱茫然的) reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed(擦破) and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary(單獨的) lighthouse(燈塔). Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds --born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed(擦過).

But even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole(空子) in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful(惡劣的) sea. Joining their horny(粗硬的) hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog(格羅格酒); and one of them: the elder(長者), too, with his face all damaged and scarred(疤) with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might be: struck up a sturdy(牢固的) song that was like a Gale in itself.

Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving(上下搖晃的) sea --on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted(停落) on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman(舵手) at the wheel, the look-out in the bow(船頭), the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed(嗡嗡作響) a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone(以往的) Christmas Day, with homeward(向家鄉) hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities(慶祝活動); and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.

It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning(呻吟聲) of the wind, and thinking what a solemn(莊嚴的) thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss(深淵), whose depths were secrets as profound(極度的) as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged(忙於……的), to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise(認出) it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability(友善的)!

"Ha, ha!" laughed Scrooge's nephew. "Ha, ha, ha!"

If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest(祝福) in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate(培養) his acquaintance(熟人).

It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection(感染) in disease(疾病) and sorrow(悲痛), there is nothing in the world so irresistibly(無法抵抗地) contagious(接觸性傳染的) as laughter(笑聲) and good-humour. When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant(過度的) contortions(扭曲): Scrooge's niece(侄女), by marriage, laughed as heartily(熱情地) as he. And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand(慢的), roared out lustily(精力充沛的).

"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!"

"He said that Christmas was a humbug(謊話), as I live!" cried Scrooge's nephew. "He believed it too!"

"More shame(遺憾) for him, Fred!" said Scrooge's niece, indignantly(憤慨的). Bless those women; they never do anything by halves. They are always in earnest(誠摯的).

She was very pretty: exceedingly(非常) pretty. With a dimpled(酒窩), surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking(激起), you know; but satisfactory(使人滿足的), too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.

"He's a comical(古怪可笑的) old fellow," said Scrooge's nephew, "that's the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against(反對) him."

"I'm sure he is very rich, Fred," hinted Scrooge's niece. "At least you always tell me so."

"What of that, my dear!" said Scrooge's nephew. "His wealth is of no use to him. He don't do any good with it. He don't make himself comfortable with it. He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is ever going to benefit(使受益) US with it."

"I have no patience with him," observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion(意見).

"Oh, I have!" said Scrooge's nephew. "I am sorry for him; I couldn't be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike(不喜歡) us, and he won't come and dine with us. What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner."

"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner," interrupted Scrooge's niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered(群) round the fire, by lamplight.

"Well! I'm very glad to hear it," said Scrooge's nephew, "because I haven't great faith in these young housekeepers. What do you say, Topper?"

Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched(苦惱的) outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge's niece's sister--the plump(豐滿的) one with the lace(蕾絲) tucker: not the one with the roses--blushed.

"Do go on, Fred," said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands. "He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous(荒唐的) fellow!"

Scrooge's nephew revelled(作樂) in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously(意見一致的) followed.

"I was only going to say," said Scrooge's nephew, "that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter companions(同伴) than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy(發黴的) old office, or his dusty(滿是灰塵的) chambers. I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity(同情) him. He may rail(抱怨) at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it--I defy(違抗) him--if he finds me going there, in good temper(情緒), year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only puts him in the vein(情緒) to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that's something; and I think I shook him yesterday."

It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge. But being thoroughly(非常) good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged(鼓舞的) them in their merriment(歡樂), and passed the bottle joyously.

After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee(快樂) or Catch, I can assure(確定地對…說) you: especially Topper, who could growl(發出低沉的吼叫) away in the bass(低音部) like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp(豎琴); and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting(訴諸) to the sexton's spade(鏟) that buried Jacob Marley.

But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first a game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage(憤慨) on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling(跌倒) over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering(使窒息) himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would have made a feint(做假動作) of endeavouring(努力) to seize you, which would have been an affront(侮辱) to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled(側身而行) off in the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not. But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken(絲綢般的) rustlings(發出輕輕的摩擦聲), and her rapid flutterings(揮動) past him, he got her into a corner whence(從那裡) there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable(極壞的). For his pretending(佯裝) not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile(邪惡的), monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential(機密的) together, behind the curtains.

Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool(腳凳), in a snug(暖和的) corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted(保證) not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt(直率的) as he took it in his head to be.

The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged(懇求) like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.

"Here is a new game," said Scrooge. "One half hour, Spirit, only one!"

It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk(生氣勃勃的) fire of questioning to which he was exposed, elicited(引出) from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable(使人厭惡的) animal, a savage(兇殘的) animal, an animal that growled and grunted(發出呼嚕聲) sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody, and didn't live in a menagerie(私人豢養野生動物), and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass(驢), or a cow, or a bull(公牛), or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly(難以言傳的) tickled(使開心), that he was obliged(必須做某事) to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:

"I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!"

"What is it?" cried Fred.

"It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!"

Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment(情緒), though some objected that the reply to "Is it a bear?" ought to have been "Yes;" inasmuch(鑑於) as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted(使改道) their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.

"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure," said Fred, "and it would be ungrateful(不感激的) not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge!'"

"Well! Uncle Scrooge!" they cried.

"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!" said Scrooge's nephew. "He wouldn't take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless(儘管如此). Uncle Scrooge!"

Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly(難以察覺的) become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged(保證) the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible(聽不見的) speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.

Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign(外國的) lands, and they were close at home; by struggling(艱難謀生的) men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was rich. In almshouse(救濟院), hospital, and jail, in misery's every refuge(庇護所), where vain(愛虛榮的) man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred(被門閂鎖住的) the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts(訓誡).

It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed(縮短) into the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward(外表的) form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey(灰色的).

"Are spirits' lives so short?" asked Scrooge.

"My life upon this globe, is very brief," replied the Ghost. "It ends to-night."

"To-night!" cried Scrooge.

"To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near."

The chimes(響) were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.

"Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask," said Scrooge, looking intently(專注地) at the Spirit's robe, "but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding(突出) from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?"

"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it," was the Spirit's sorrowful reply. "Look here."

From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject(極度恐怖等), frightful, hideous(極醜的), miserable(痛苦的). They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.

"Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!" exclaimed the Ghost.

They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre(不足的), ragged(破爛的), scowling(怒目而視), wolfish(狼一般的); but prostrate(匍伏的), too, in their humility(謙恭). Where graceful(優雅的) youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale(不新鮮的) and shrivelled(乾枯) hand, like that of age, had pinched(蒼白清瘦的), and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing(威脅的). No change, no degradation(玷污), no perversion(歪曲) of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread(感到恐懼).

Scrooge started back, appalled(使驚駭). Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous(極大的) magnitude(重要性).

"Spirit! are they yours?" Scrooge could say no more.

"They are Man's," said the Spirit, looking down upon them. "And they cling(依附) to me, appealing(懇求的) from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance(無知). This girl is Want(想要). Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow(額頭) I see that written which is Doom(毀滅), unless the writing be erased(擦掉). Deny(否定) it!" cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. "Slander(詆毀) those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious(好搞派別活動的) purposes, and make it worse. And bide(靜候時機) the end!"

"Have they no refuge or resource?" cried Scrooge.

"Are there no prisons?" said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. "Are there no workhouses?"

The bell struck twelve.

Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased(停止) to vibrate(震動), he remembered the prediction(預言) of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld(看見) a solemn Phantom, draped(把…披／搭／蒙) and hooded, coming, like a mist(薄霧) along the ground, towards him.
